The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem
seems to be buggy

Certain folders are not found by Directory Reader
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemDirectoryReader
In Project: traverseFileSystem function

There is a screenshot in this directory showing how upon uploading folder "github.com"
certain folders are not detected therefore their files inside are not uploaded.

Folder "github.com" is also in this directory zipped

SOLUTION:
If using Chrome, another api must be used for file system traversing
The FileSystemAccessApi
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API

It is only supported on Chrome, Edge, Opera. NOT on Firefox

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransferItem
DataTransferItem.getAsFileSystemHandle()
