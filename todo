        have a chance to get sent before worker is closed
    webkitRelative Path on Chrome
    the not full backup on chrome(size progress discrepancy)

    Standartize the getting size procedure
    Make text appear bottom of file
    Make browse view refrest after upload

TODO features:
    Add download
    Add upload at browsed folder
    Add "are you sure want to replace". Requires prefligh
    Add users
        Initially just folder for users

TODO test:

Achievments:
    The backup works with big folders with alot of files
    Runs in Web Worker, the UI is 100% smooth

BigHurdles:
    There is a memory leak on firefox. Its seems to be firefox`s falt, it seems to also
    happen when uploading file in google drive.
