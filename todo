PotentialBugs&ExistingBugs:
    File and Directory Entries API is buggy on Chrome
    the not full backup on chrome(size progress discrepancy)
    some folders inside .git dont get uploaded

TODO features:
    Add upload at browsed folder
    Add "are you sure want to replace". Requires prefligh
    Add users
        Initially just folder for users
    Sort by first showing dirs

Achievments:
    The backup works with big folders with alot of files
    Runs in Web Worker, the UI is 100% smooth

BigHurdles:
    There is a memory leak on firefox. Its seems to be firefox`s falt, it seems to also
        happen when uploading file in google drive.

Notes:
    empty folders are not uploaded
    Firefox(checked only there):   
        symbolic links CONTENT is uploaded
